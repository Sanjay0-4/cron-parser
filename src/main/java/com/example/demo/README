# Cron Expression Parser

This project provides a Java implementation for parsing and validating cron expressions. It breaks down a cron expression into its constituent fields and validates each according to specified rules. The main classes include `CronExpression`, `CronField`, `CronFieldType`, and utility classes for error handling and testing.

## Features

- **Parse Cron Expressions:** Split and interpret cron expressions into minute, hour, day of month, month, and day of week fields.
- **Validation:** Ensure that each field's values fall within valid ranges and follow correct formats.
- **Custom Exceptions:** Handle parsing errors gracefully with descriptive messages.
- **Unit Testing:** Comprehensive tests to validate the parsing and validation logic.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Maven (for building the project and running tests)
